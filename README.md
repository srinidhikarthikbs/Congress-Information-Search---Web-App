# Congress Information Search - Web App

This web application is developed to be a one-stop portal for all the information pertaining to the US Congress, including Legislators, Bills, and Committees. The app is developed using AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap and PHP at the back-end.

## Getting Started

Just visit http://srinidhisample.appspot.com for the live demo. If the free hosting account is taken down, don’t worry! You can host it by yourself in your hosting space and witness the show. 

All you need to do, is host all the files at one place. Run an apache server to make the PHP scripts work, and you’re good to go!

### Setting up the API

The API used for the purpose was the Congress API, provided for public usage, by http://sunlightfoundation.com. Just register for an API key with them replace it in the PHP file variable $api_key, and the API should start working.
